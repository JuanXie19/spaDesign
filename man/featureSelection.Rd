\title{Select Domain-Informative Genes for Each Spatial Domain
This function selects genes with large absolute fold change and high within-domain expression
for each spatial domain. The selected genes are stored in the \code{topGenes} slot of the
\code{shinyDesign} object.}
\usage{
featureSelection(
  shinyDesign,
  logfc_cutoff,
  mean_in_cutoff,
  max_num_gene,
  n_cores
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shinyDesign}{A \code{shinyDesign} object.}

\item{logfc_cutoff}{Numeric value specifying the threshold for log fold change,
used to select genes with significant differential expression within vs outside domain.}

\item{mean_in_cutoff}{Numeric value specifying the minimum mean log-transformed expression within the domain.}

\item{max_num_gene}{Integer specifying the maximum number of genes that can be selected per spatial domain.}
}
\value{
Returns the input \code{shinyDesign} object with the \code{topGenes} slot updated
with the selected genes for each domain.
}
\description{
Select Domain-Informative Genes for Each Spatial Domain
This function selects genes with large absolute fold change and high within-domain expression
for each spatial domain. The selected genes are stored in the \code{topGenes} slot of the
\code{shinyDesign} object.
}
\details{
Genes are selected by filtering based on \code{logfc_cutoff} and \code{mean_in_cutoff}.
If too few genes meet both criteria, the union of individual criteria is used.
The top genes are then ordered by descending absolute logFC and truncated
to \code{max_num_gene}.

\examples{
# Assuming you have a shinyDesign object named `my_spadesign`
my_spadesign <- featureSelection(my_spadesign, logfc_cutoff = 0.7, mean_in_cutoff = 2, max_num_gene = 10)
# Access the selected genes
top_genes <- my_spadesign@topGenes
}
